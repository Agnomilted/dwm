This is my build of suckless.org's window manager, dwm. It is under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
The source can be installed from https://www.github.com/Agnomilted/dwm.

Prerequisites:
	You need these packages to compile dwm:
	build-essential
	xorg-dev
	dmenu
	firefox-esr
	st
	rofi
	libreoffice
	git

Installing and compiling:
	Installing: After installing all the prerequisites, install the source using the command
	git clone https://www.github.com/Agnomilted/dwm
	After installing, change your directory to where git installed the directory. After which use the command(as root if necessary)
	make clean install
	Consult either the internet or people you know who know gcc and the C programming language as I will probably not help you if an error occurs during 
	compilation. After successfully compiling the window manager, either make an xsession or modify your ~/.xinitrc file and add the line
	exec dwm
	to a referenced script. An example script is provided in the file ./start. 

Configuration:
	Having the source code is important because configuration of the window manager is done with changing either the file config.def.h or config.h in the 
	source code. I recommend copying the file config.def.h to config.h and having the file config.def.h as a backup. Changing the source code to configure
	the window manager may seem too hard, but it really isn't. It may be harder than the average config file but it will be much easier if you learn some 
	C or C++ or if you have previous experience with configuring window managers. One thing you should not forget is that you should recompile the source
	code after changing the config file as it isn't read at runtime like other window managers.
